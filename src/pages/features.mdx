title: "Features"

## Introduction

This starter is based on [Gatsby Advance Starter](https://github.com/Vagr9K/gatsby-advanced-starter) and further develop into a separate starter with custom basic features. This is the first attempt for me contributing to the community, so please let me know if there are anythings that can be improved.

This starter would be a great place to start if you are looking for a clean and minimal blog setup, at the same time following the latest design trend with Dark Mode, supporting latest Gatsby features. Moderate code editing will be required in order to launch the site.

## Features

### Dark Mode

Dark Mode using [`gatsby-plugin-use-dark-mode`](https://github.com/wKovacs64/gatsby-plugin-use-dark-mode) and [`react-toggle-dark-mode`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dark-mode-toggle). This starter use `styled-components` but the color tokens have been implemented by simple CSS variables method.

I have also spend a long time on nailing the light / dark color scheme together with the component style, so feel free to use it as well. Color Tokens can be found in `src/utils/styles/color.css`.

### MDX

Gatsby Advance Starter was still using Markdown, I have updated it to support MDX with all basic dependencies, you can create a new page in `src/pages` folder and start writing in Markdown instantly.

### Table Of Content

Minimal Table of Content Component that will subtlely hinted the length of the articles, with headings displaying on hover. Available on screens larger than tablet only.

### Menu

Update the navigation menu in `static/SiteConfig.js` to customize your menu.
